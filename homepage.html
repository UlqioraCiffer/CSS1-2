        <p id="Three">THE MAGIC OF GLOWING CREATURES</p>
        <p id="Four"> Did you know some animals and plants can glow in the dark? This cool trick is called
            bioluminescence. It happens when a special chemical reaction inside their bodies creates light. It's
            like nature's version of neon lights!</p>
        <p id="Five">Here's how it works:</p>
        <ol id="LItwo">
            <li>A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen.</li>
            <li>An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process.</li>
            <li>Voila! A glow appears, but without heat - it's called “cold light.”</li>
        </ol>
